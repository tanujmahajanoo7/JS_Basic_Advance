## Learning Path

1. Start with **01_basics** to understand fundamental concepts
2. Move through **02_basics** and **03_basics** for core data structures and functions
3. Learn **04_control_flow** and **05_iterations** for program flow control
4. Practice with **06_dom** and **08_events** for web interactivity
5. Build projects in **07_projects** to apply knowledge
6. Advance to **09_advance_one** for asynchronous programming
7. Master **10_classes_and_oop** for object-oriented patterns
8. Explore **11_fun_with_js** for advanced concepts like closures

## Notes

- Each folder contains its own README with detailed information
